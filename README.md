### Hi there,  ğŸ˜€ğŸ‘‹

## You'd see here that I mostly have built small mobile apps with: ğŸ“±
- ğŸ’¡Java (grandmother)
- ğŸ’¡Kotlin (granddaughter)
- ğŸ’¡Dart (Side chick..lol)
- I'm enthusiastic about open source development, with my first contribution being: [CourierApplication]
- ğŸ˜„Let's collaborate to build cool tiny moving pixels that make everyone's life easier on their mobile device

### May the code be with you!
