# News and Development
updated on Dec. 10, 2024
-ðŸ˜ªAI is changing the way we write codeðŸ˜‘ For someone who actively started writing code in 2020ðŸ˜§, the way we write code has changed
- Will a software developer still be relevant with the recent speed of AI tools like ChatGpt, Claude, and their respective agents?ðŸ˜ª
